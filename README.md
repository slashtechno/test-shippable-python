# Simple, shippable Python projects  

## A disclaimer  
Ideally, learn [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/). It will allow you to manage dependencies in a much easier manner while making sure every project has a unique virtual environment. In addition, it will allow you to [build and publish to PyPi](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/package/), so people can install your project with a simple `pip install <your project>`.  

The setup in this repository is more for when you're at a hackathon or need to quickly ship a project that can easily be experienced by others, a major requirement for [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) YSWS programs. You can take an existing Python project and you should be able to pretty quickly compile it so it can run on most Windows, MacOS (only ARM/M-series), and Linux machines with a simple click. 

Hi! If you're a beginniner to Python, you might wonder, how do you get your projects to run on other machines?
